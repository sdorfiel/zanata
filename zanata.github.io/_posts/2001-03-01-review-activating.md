Translation review can be turned on or off for any project-version in Zanata. When translation review is turned off, translations are considered ready to use when they are saved as 'translated' by a translator. When translation review is turned on, translations are not considered ready to use until a reviewer has marked them as 'approved'. More information on the review workflow can be found at [Review Workflow]({{ site.url }}/help/review/review-workflow)

Translation review adds extra time and effort to the translation process, so is not recommended for all projects.


Translation review can be turned on or off when creating or editing a version. For version creation, see [Create a version]({{ site.url }}/help/projects/create-version).

To edit a version from the project page, find the version in the summary table and click the `Edit` button.

Turning review off and on will not cause approved translations to lose their approved status. Approved translations will remain approved unless they are replaced with another translation. When review is turned off,  approved translations will be treated the same as translations in the 'translated' state.
