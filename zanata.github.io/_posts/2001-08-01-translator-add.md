*Note: A message will be sent to the coordinator or coordinators for the language team. The additional information you provide helps the coordinators identify you and establish that you are a capable translator for the language. Links to examples of your work are particularly useful.*


## Processing Membership Requests (for Coordinators)

When a user requests membership in a language team that you coordinate, you will receive an email with the details of their request. It is up to your professional judgement whether to add a user to your language team, based on the information they provide and any prior knowledge you have of their translation ability.

To add the user to a language team:

 1. Click the link in the email to go to the language team page. Alternatively, navigate to the language team page using the site menu.
 1. Click `Add Team Member` on the right.
