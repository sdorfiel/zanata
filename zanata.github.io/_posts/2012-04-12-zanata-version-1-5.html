<p>
  The spiffy new version of the
  <span>Zanata</span>
  Translation Management system is now ready and has been released.
</p>
<p>
  Besides a new look with Zanata’s purple theme, this version packs in a punch with loads of exciting new features in the translation editor interface and several important bug fixes. Translators can now use <em>status filters on the strings</em>
  , <em>run validation checks</em>
  and get more out of the
  <em>improved Translation Memory system</em>
  with more efficient
  <em>translation matches</em>
  ,
  <em>text highlights</em>
  and
  <em>shortcut keys</em>
  . Package Maintainers can now choose to deprecate projects and iterations that are no longer relevant. Significant improvements have been made to the Zanata Python and Maven clients. The latter now allows projects with multiple modules to share a configuration file. A complete list of the new features and known issues in this release is available in the
  <a href="http://zanata.org/docs/Zanata_Release_Notes_1.5/html/index.html">Release Notes</a>
